# Designing a Space Probe
<p align="justify">The exploration of space is a driving force for mankind for understanding the universe. The universe holds many answers to various questions and in order to answer these questions, it is essential to explore the far reaches of our solar system as well as our whole universe.  However, due to limitations in exploration and due to requirements for prolonged	life	support	it	is only possible to explore deep reaches of space through the use of robotic space probes.</p>

<p align="center">Through the efforts of  NASA and ESA many robotic space probes have been launched to explore nearby asteroids and comets. However, for these types of deep space missions, the robotic space probe is often far away from the Earth and it may be difficult to meet the long range, long duration requirements of these types of missions. Hence, special artificial intelligence protocols need to be implemented, so that when the space probe is out of touch for any reason, it can still continue on its work. In addition, the power source aboard the robotic space probe will have to be strong and versatile enough to meet the requirements of the mission. To cope with the rough terrain encountered on most of the planets, new locomotion concepts for rovers and micro-rovers have to be developed and investigated. Planetary rovers are small unmanned vehicles equipped with cameras and a variety of sensors used for scientific experiments, that must operate under tight constraints over such resources as operation time, power, storage capacity, and communication bandwidth.</p> 

<p align="center">This project is hardware and software based working model which uses different sensors, cameras and other equipments which would be required by a space probe on space exploration of different planet. Some changes are made on the basis of study of different models sent, which if incorporated may make the probes more durable, economical and beneficial for long duration of projects. </p>
